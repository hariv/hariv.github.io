### Aragorn: An Automated and Extensible Privacy-Enhancing System for Mobile Cameras
Jan 21 2022
Mobile app developers often rely on high-quality
cameras to implement rich functionalities. However, giving apps
unfettered access to the mobile camera poses a serious threat

mobile camera system that automatically sanitizes camera frames
to only contain user-authorized objects without needing any
manual user input.
